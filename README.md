# Python Projects: To-Do List, Calculator, and Password Generator

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python projects: a **To-Do List** application, a **Calculator**, and a **Password Generator**. Each project demonstrates core Python programming skills and can be run directly in the command line or with a GUI (depending on your preference).

Projects Overview

Task 1: To-Do List Application

The **To-Do List** application helps users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. This project can be built as either a command-line or GUI-based application, allowing users to:
**Create** new tasks
**Update** existing tasks
**Track** tasks by marking them as completed or pending

Features:
Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed or pending.
List all tasks with their status.
  
Technologies Used:
Python (for logic and task management)
(Optional) Tkinter (for GUI-based interface)

Task 2: Simple Calculator

The **Simple Calculator** is a basic arithmetic application where users can input two numbers and choose an operation to perform. The calculator supports basic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Features:
Accepts two numbers as input from the user.
- Prompts the user for an arithmetic operation.
- Displays the result of the operation.

Technologies Used:
- Python (for calculations and user input handling)

 Task 3: Password Generator

The **Password Generator** is a tool that generates strong, random passwords for users. The application allows users to specify the desired length and complexity of the password and then generates a secure password accordingly.

Features:
- User input for password length.
- Optionally, allow the inclusion of special characters, digits, and uppercase letters.
- Generates a random password and displays it to the user.

Technologies Used:
- Python (for generating random characters and creating the password)
- `random` module (to ensure randomness and security)
